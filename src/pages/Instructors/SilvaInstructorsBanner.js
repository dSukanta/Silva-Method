                        In most meditative training, you are told what to do but not why you do it.
                        Silva Instructors not only guide you through the meditative experience, they thoroughly explain your experience, step-by-step,
                        so that you can duplicate it easily, anytime and anywhere. Silva Instructors train you to understand and use what we call subjective
                        points of reference that will help deepen your meditative experience every time you practice.
